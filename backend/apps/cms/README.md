## Usage Examples

**Note: All examples require admin authentication with a valid admin user token.**

### Creating a Post with Attachments
```bash
# Via API (Admin token required)
curl -X POST /api/v1/posts/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "My Blog Post", 
    "content": "This is the post content...",
    "excerpt": "A brief description",
    "status": "draft",
    "is_featured": false,
    "attachment_ids": ["uuid1", "uuid2"]
  }'
```

### Publishing a Post
```bash
curl -X POST /api/v1/posts/{id}/publish/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>"
```

### Uploading an Attachment
```bash
curl -X POST /api/v1/attachments/upload/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>" \
  -F "file=@image.jpg" \
  -F "title=My Image" \
  -F "is_public=true"
```

### Filtering Posts (Admin only)
```bash
# Get featured posts
GET /api/v1/posts/?is_featured=true
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>

# Search posts  
GET /api/v1/posts/?search=django
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>

# Get posts by author
GET /api/v1/posts/?author_username=john
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
```

### Uploading and Attaching Files
```python
# 1. Upload file
POST /api/v1/attachments/upload/
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
{
    "name": "My Image",
    "file": <file_data>,
    "file_type": "image",
    "is_public": true
}

# 2. Attach to post
POST /api/v1/posts/{post_id}/attach_file/
{
    "attachment_id": "attachment_uuid"
}
```

### Publishing Workflow
```python
# 1. Create draft
POST /api/v1/posts/ {"title": "...", "status": "draft"}

# 2. Publish when ready
POST /api/v1/posts/{id}/publish/
```

## Integration

The CMS app integrates seamlessly with the existing Django project structure:

- **Uses existing models**: Post and Attachment models from `apps.posts` and `apps.attachments`
- **Leverages core permissions**: Uses permission classes from `apps.core.permissions`
- **Follows project patterns**: Consistent with other app structures in the project
- **Minimal overhead**: No new models or complex relationships

## Development Notes

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Reuse existing models** instead of creating new ones
2. **Use `generic_key="post"`** to identify CMS posts
3. **Simplified API** focused on essential CRUD operations
4. **Leverages existing relationships** (User, Post, Attachment)
5. **Maintains compatibility** with existing post functionality

### Future Enhancements
- Category/tag system (if needed)
- Rich text editor integration
- Bulk operations
- Content versioning
- Workflow management
- Content scheduling
